# Queue in C++ 🚀

Welcome to the **Queue in C++** repository! This repository is dedicated to learning and implementing **Queue data structures** in C++. I will be uploading **daily codes** of important questions covering various types of queues and their real-world applications. Stay tuned for structured learning and hands-on coding! 💡

## 📌 Learning Plan

### **SESSION 1: Introduction to Queue**
#### What is a Queue?
A queue is a **linear data structure** that follows the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle.

💡 Think of it like a real-world queue at a ticket counter:
- The first person who comes stands first in the line.
- The last person joins at the end.
- The first person gets served and leaves first.

#### **Characteristics of Queue**
✔️ **FIFO Order** – First inserted element is removed first.
✔️ **Two Main Operations:**
   - **Enqueue** (Insertion) → Add an element at the back.
   - **Dequeue** (Removal) → Remove an element from the front.
✔️ **Front & Rear** – Helps in tracking the first and last elements.
✔️ **Fixed or Dynamic Size** – Can be implemented using **arrays (fixed size)** or **linked lists (dynamic size).**

#### **Real-World Applications of Queue**
🚀 **Operating Systems** – Process scheduling, task queues.
🚀 **Networking** – Handling requests in routers, load balancers.
🚀 **Customer Service** – Call center support systems.
🚀 **Printing Jobs** – Printer queue in an office.

### **📌 SESSION 2: Implementing Queue using Arrays**
#### **Basic Operations of Queue**
✔️ **enqueue(x)** – Add element `x` at the rear.
✔️ **dequeue()** – Remove element from the front.
✔️ **front()** – Get the front element.
✔️ **rear()** – Get the rear element.
✔️ **isEmpty()** – Check if the queue is empty.
✔️ **isFull()** – Check if the queue is full.

### **📌 SESSION 3: Circular Queue (Fixing the Issue in Normal Queue)**
✅ In a **circular queue**, the rear wraps around to the front when space is available.
✅ It uses the **modulus operator (%)** to achieve circular movement.

---

### **🚀 SESSION 4: Queue using Linked List**
(No size limit, dynamic memory allocation)

---

### **🚀 SESSION 5: Priority Queue**
(Elements processed based on priority rather than FIFO)

---

### **🚀 SESSION 6: Double-Ended Queue (Deque)**
(Insert & delete from both ends)

---

### **🚀 SESSION 7: STL Queue in C++**
(Using built-in Queue functions in C++)

---

### **🚀 SESSION 8: Advanced Applications & Competitive Programming Questions**
(Real-world applications, coding challenges, and problem-solving techniques)
